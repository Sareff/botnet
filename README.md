# Simple bot for checkboxing stuff in [dist.kait20.ru](http://dist.kait20.ru/)

If you are using *Anaconda* just type:
    
    bash install.sh

or:
    
    ./install.sh

If you are not, install all packages from `environment.yml`.

WARNING:
File named `oldhack.py` is, as you can see, the old verion of bot. It hasn't OOP model of users, and some other things, like indentation. But still, the file will stand in repository for history.
